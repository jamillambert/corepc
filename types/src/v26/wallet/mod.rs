///
/// > Creates and loads a new wallet.
///
/// > Arguments:
/// > 1. wallet_name             (string, required) The name for the new wallet. If this is a path, the wallet will be created at the path location.
/// > 2. disable_private_keys    (boolean, optional, default=false) Disable the possibility of private keys (only watchonlys are possible in this mode).
/// > 3. blank                   (boolean, optional, default=false) Create a blank wallet. A blank wallet has no keys or HD seed. One can be set using sethdseed.
/// > 4. passphrase              (string, optional) Encrypt the wallet with this passphrase.
/// > 5. avoid_reuse             (boolean, optional, default=false) Keep track of coin reuse, and treat dirty and clean coins differently with privacy considerations in mind.
/// > 6. descriptors             (boolean, optional, default=true) Create a native descriptor wallet. The wallet will use descriptors internally to handle address creation. Setting to "false" will create a legacy wallet; however, the legacy wallet type is being deprecated and support for creating and opening legacy wallets will be removed in the future.
/// > 7. load_on_startup         (boolean, optional) Save wallet name to persistent settings and load on startup. True to add wallet to startup list, false to remove, null to leave unchanged.
/// > 8. external_signer         (boolean, optional, default=false) Use an external signer such as a hardware wallet. Requires -signer to be configured. Wallet creation will fail if keys cannot be fetched. Requires disable_private_keys and descriptors set to true.
